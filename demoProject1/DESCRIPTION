Description: A small set of pragmatic helper functions and examples for a workshop on
    clean R code for statisticians. It demonstrates explicit inputs/outputs, lightweight
    assertions with custom messages, safe CSV loading, simple completeness filtering,
    and concise parameter summaries. Intended for teaching and internal demos rather
    than general-purpose production use.
