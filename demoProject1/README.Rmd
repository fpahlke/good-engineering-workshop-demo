A small set of pragmatic helper functions and examples for a workshop on
clean R code for statisticians. It demonstrates explicit inputs/outputs,
lightweight assertions with custom messages, safe CSV loading, simple
completeness filtering, and concise parameter summaries. Intended for
teaching and internal demos rather     than general-purpose production use.
